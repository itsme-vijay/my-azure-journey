## ⚡ Lab 5: Create Azure Virtual Network and Connect Two VMs Internally (via Ping/ICMP)

In this lab, you'll learn how to create a **Virtual Network** and deploy two **Windows Virtual Machines** inside it. You'll configure them so they can talk to each other internally — using `ping`, a common network testing command!

Perfect for understanding the basics of Azure networking, internal communication, and firewall/port rule setup. 🔐

### 🧠 What You’ll Learn:

- What Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) are and why they matter
- How to create a custom VNet with IP ranges and subnets
- How to deploy Windows VMs inside a VNet
- How to use Network Security Groups (NSGs) to allow or block traffic
- How to connect to VMs using RDP (Remote Desktop)
- How to enable internal communication between two VMs using ICMP/ping

📁 This folder contains step-by-step **screenshots** to walk you visually through each task of the lab.
